# Pick-and-Place-using-ROS
The problem of pick and place refers to the challenge of automating the process of picking up objects from one location and placing them with precision in another location within an industrial setting. This task is commonly encountered in manufacturing, assembly, packaging, and logistics industries.To achieve this goal, we propose to use ROS (Robot Operating System) and the MoveIt motion planning library. The system combines the power of computer vision, ROS, and MoveIt to enable accurate object detection, localization, and precise motion planning for pick and place operations. The camera provides real-time visual feedback, while ROS and MoveIt facilitate seamless integration, control, and coordination of the UR5 arm.
